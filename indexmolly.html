  the source for information about Socrates' life and personality.
  Plato and Xenophon were about forty years younger than Socrates,
  so they only knew him during his last ten years of his life.
  Socrates father was a sculptor and his mother a midwife. Socrates
  married Xanthippe late in his life and they had three sons. In
  399, Anytus indicted Socrates for impiety. The two charges were
  corrupting the youth and neglecting the gods. They convicted
  Socrates and condemned to death. His friend Crito devised an
  escape plan, but Socrates chose not to leave, because a legitimate
  court made the ruling and being a good citizen he must obey the
  law. (Source: </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Hoefler Text"><A

  Apology</I> <I>of Socrates</I> is a dialogue, about the trial
  of Socrates, in which Socrates answers the charges of his accusers
  with a short history of his life and morals. Socrates is adressing
  the charge that he is corrupting the youth when he says, &quot;Those
  things I do not know, I do not think I know.&quot; Socrates is
  explaing that the young men copy his method of questioning people,
  because it shows people that there is always more to learn. (</FONT><FONT
