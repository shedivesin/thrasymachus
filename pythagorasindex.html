      <P>&nbsp;This famous saying from Pythagoras gives us the English
      maxim &quot;Well begun is half done.&quot; Literally, Pythagoras
      said, &quot;The beginning is half of everything,&quot; which
      reflects the philosopher's outlook on life. Pythagoras approached
      all problems with full intensity, believing that the harder he
      worked, the better the outcome. Pythagoras not only advanced
      the world of mathematics in his day, but also merged several
      different philosophies to create his own, Pythagoreanism, from
      which we can better understand the man and his beliefs. </P>

      <P>Pythagoras, who is thought to have lived in the sixth century
      BCE, can properly be called the Greek father of mathematics,
      since his discoveries led to the later advancements Greek mathematicians
      would make. After founding a school and a secret society, Pythagoras
      and his followers set out to study math for the sake of math,
      with no goal in mind but to learn more. For this reason, we cannot
      know for sure which discoveries were Pythagoras' own, since his
      own work merged with the work of his followers. Pythagoras' two
      most well known discoveries are the Pythagorean theorem, which
      allows us to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle, and
      the formula expressing the relationship between the sides and
      the diagonal of a square. </P>

      <P>All ancient records of Pythagoras are found in works by other
      authors, so our knowledge of this great thinker is entirely based
      upon secondary sources. This saying is attributed to Pythagoras,
      though we cannot be sure of its origin. Although modern scholars
      cannot be certain of Pythagoras' advances within the world of
      mathematics, it is certain that his saying reflected his life:
      the beginning of modern mathematics, which started with Pythagoras,
      set the events in motion which led to math as we know it.<BR>
