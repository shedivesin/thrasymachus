      by Critias, in which he retells a story that befell Solon, &quot;wisest
      of the Seven.&quot; Solon, while traveling in the Nile Delta,
      decided to tell the people the most ancient Greek myths. While
      he was doing so, one of the local priests came up to him and
      said, &quot;O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children: there
      is no such a thing as an old Greek.&quot; Hearing this, Solon
      was naturally curious as to why he had been thus accused. The
      old priest explained to him that the Greeks are young in soul,
      for they do not &quot;possess a single belief that is ancient
      and derived from old tradition, nor yet one science that is hoary
      with age.&quot;</FONT></CENTER></H5>
