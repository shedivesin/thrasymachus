      <P>&nbsp; In this quote, from Plutarch's <I>Moralia</I>, a Spartan
      mother is sending her son off to war. When she gives him his
      shield, she tells him that she wants him to come back either
      with the shield, if he survives, or upon the shield if he is
      killed. You will notice alphas where you might expect etas. These
      reflect the Spartan's Doric dialect.</P>

      <P>Plutarch was one of the most famous of the classical writers,
      composing numerous manuscripts and essays. His insights on human
      life and thought were renowned throughout the known world and
      were popular up to the early 1900s, until the advent of television
      and other forms of entertainment. By his writings and lectures
      Plutarch became a celebrity in the Roman empire, yet he returned
      to reside in Boeotia where he had been born in 50 CE. He participated
      actively in local affairs, even serving as mayor. At his country
      estate, guests from all over the empire congregated for serious
      conversation, presided over by Plutarch in his marble chair.
      Many of these dialogues were recorded and published, and the78
      essays and other works which have survived are now known collectively
      as the <I>Moralia</I>. Plutarch's essays and his lectures established
      him as a leading thinker in the Roman empire's golden age. Plutarch
      went on to write <I>Parallel Lives</I>, intended to be pairs
      of biographies of two different people. It became a monumental
      study on humanity in general.
