  <P><FONT COLOR="#00a200" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Homer,
  one of the most acclaimed authors of the history of the world,
  is a man shrouded in mystery. Scholars often speculate whether
  such a man even existed. No one knows if the blind poet known
  to later ages as Homer existed or if he actually ever wrote the
  epics,<I> The Iliad and the Odyssey</I>; or did a group of bards
  after hundreds of years of reciting the Greek tales, decide to
  write them down? Whatever is the case, the man known as Homer
  has clearly been one of the most influential writers of all time.
  The two works are timeless. <I>The Iliad </I>and<I> The Odyssey</I>
  are still studied and analyzed by students and scholars worldwide,
  2,700 years after their composition. To this day, the feats of
  characters such as Achilles, Paris, Agamemnon, and Odysseus continue
  to inspire and intrigue people throughout the world.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#009d00" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">The
  Odyssey is a historical fiction epic about Odysseus' travels
  and adventures on his 20 year journey to return home to Ithaca
  after the Trojan War ends. It is a story about fidelity, faith,
  perseverence, and love. The epic begins <I>in medias res</I>
  with Odysseus being held captive on the island of Calypso. After
  his release, he builds a raft to continue his journey home, but
  Poseidon causes a great storm which pummels both him and his
  raft on the sea. Some time later, Odysseus washes up exhausted
  and naked on the shores of Phaeacia, a great but isolated civilization.
  There at a great banquet held in Odysseus' honor, he recounts
  his great adventures. He describes his participation in the Trojan
  War and the fall of Troy, his departure with all his men from
  Ilium, his wily escape from the cyclops, his captivity on Calypso's
  island, and finally his arrival at Phaeacia. After Odysseus finishes
  his tale, he concludes with the line, &quot;And now it is time
  to sleep.&quot; After his epic story, long travels, and great
  feats, Odysseus states that there should be time for recuperation
  and rest, even for a heroic and quasi-immortal figures such as
  he.</FONT></P>
