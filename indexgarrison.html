  <P><FONT COLOR="#ff6600" SIZE="+1" FACE="Andale Mono">Demosthenes
  was considered &quot;the greatest of the Attic orators&quot;
  of the first century BC. Demosthenes was part of a very wealthy
  family in Athens. When Demosthenes was young, his parents died
  and the family estate was left in the hands of a few guardians.
  The guardians had squandered the family fortune by the time Demosthenes
  was old enough to inherit it. At this time, Demosthenes sued
  the guardians in order to regain the money that they had lost.
  He prosecuted the case so well that people began to ask him to
  orate on their behalf and to provide them with counsel.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#ff6600" SIZE="+1" FACE="Andale Mono">Demosthenes
  had many very important Athenian figures as clients. One of these
  was a banker, Phormio. Phormio was one of the richest men in
  Athens. Demosthenes won many cases for him. In one suit, the
  jury awarded Phormio 20 talents (approximately $10 million) after
  hearing only Demosthenes' argument. They didn't even bother to
  listen to the other side as his argument was so convincing.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#ff6600" SIZE="+1" FACE="Andale Mono">Demosthenes
  became more involved in public affairs cases in 355 BC. He continued
  to prosecute private cases throughout his career, but his main
  interest was in public policy. In particular, he liked to deal
  with affairs between Athens and Macedonia. It is for these public
  affairs cases that he is especially remembered.</FONT></P>
