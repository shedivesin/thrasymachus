  <P><FONT COLOR="#000040" FACE="Times New Roman">Students of Ancient
  Greek approach this discipline for a variety of reasons. They
  appreciate the beauty, clarity, and concise nature of the language,
  or they are fascinated with the culture which has had such an
  impact upon our own and to which we have exceptional access through
  its abundant linguistic and archaeological record. In order to
  have a better understanding of this culture and its literature,
  they need to read and comprehend its texts, not merely translate
  them word for word. To this end classicists, archaeologists,
  philosophers, historians, theologians, and anyone with an avid
  interest in the Graeco-Roman world will want to develop the tools
  for approaching a Greek text, whether it is an Homeric epic,
  a tragedy of Euripides, a philosophical treatise of Plato, a
  history by Thucydides, or an inscription on a monument or painted
  vase.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#000040" FACE="Times New Roman">Traditional textbooks
  for learning Ancient Greek often focus on the acquisition of
  grammar and syntax largely out of context, often with complicated
  explanations. More recently, the varied linguistic preparation
  of students and changing pedagogy have led to the development
  of reading and even oral methods.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000040" FACE="Times New Roman">In these times,
  it can no longer be assumed that college bound students will
  have a thorough background in formal English grammar and Latin
  or that they will know the Homeric and Vergilian epics in translation.
  With the explosion of computer technology and information retrieval
  we no longer learn primarily by rote memorization, lecture, and
  book reading. Our current situation warrants a re-evaluation
  of teaching goals and methods.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#000040" FACE="Times New Roman">Years of experience
  in teaching Ancient Greek have led us to prefer a reading approach,
  in which students acquire grammar and vocabulary in the context
  of continuous Greek passages with cultural value. In our experience,
  we have found that <I>Thrasymachus </I>by Peckett and Munday
  (initially published in 1965; published by Bristol Classical
  Press in 1984 and reprinted in 1990) is a superb introduction
  to ancient Greek because it requires students to learn grammar
  and vocabulary in context. The continuous narrative fosters a
  steady, gradual acquisition of grammar and vocabulary and supports
  the development of skills which transfer readily to the reading
  of Greek literature. Students genuinely enjoy the readings as
  they are introduced to themes from Greek myth, tragedy, and epic.
  These lead easily to classroom discussions and further explorations.
  It is the intellectual excitement generated by <I>Thrasymachus
  </I>that gives purpose to the effort of learning the intricacies
  of ancient Greek.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#000040" FACE="Times New Roman">Realizing that
  our students come to us with varied linguistic backgrounds and
  abilities and often needing to teach English to make the Greek
  understandable, we saw the need for providing a supplementary
  text to accompany <I>Thrasymachus</I> which would address these
  issues. This on-line supplement is intended especially for those
  who have begun their study of Greek without prior work in Latin
  and for those whose knowledge of English grammar may be less
  than thorough. It will also serve students who would benefit
  from further explanations of grammar or from exercises and structured
  review.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000040" FACE="Times New Roman">In our experience
  students who use <I>Thrasymachus</I> for their introduction to
  Greek benefit the most from working their way through the reading
  as its authors intended. Students begin by reading a chapter,
  with the primary purpose of understanding the story, together
  with an instructor who helps by identifying new forms or introducing
  new vocabulary. It is only after they have encountered new forms
  and syntax in context that the students learn the forms and grammatical
  points in isolation. It is the initial process of reading and
  comprehending, not just translating word for word and memorizing
  forms, that is most important for continuous progress in learning
  Greek.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#000040" FACE="Times New Roman">We have designed
  this supplement to explicate and reinforce the material presented
  in <I>Thrasymachus</I> after the students&#146; initial reading.
  We begin by providing information on grammar &#151; definitions,
  explanations, and examples from both Greek and English &#151;
  referring to the information in <I>Thrasymachus</I> when appropriate.
  Forms are then presented, and exercises based closely on the
  <I>Thrasymachus</I> readings or on passages from Greek authors
  which appear at the end of the textbook. Lists of vocabulary
  drawn from the reading in each chapter are provided in <I>Thrasymachus</I>.
  Students will find that the most important words for a beginning
  vocabulary are repeated in the text of each chapter and that
  rereading a chapter will facilitate the learning of this vocabulary.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#000040" FACE="Times New Roman">Because we see
  this supplement to <I>Thrasymachus </I>as an introduction to
  Ancient Greek, we have aimed for clarity and simplicity. We expect
  that students will gain a solid foundation upon which to understand
  the new material in the readings and to pursue a thorough mastery
  of the language in subsequent study. At this stage, for example,
  we emphasize the memorization of only the most basic forms and
  of those that are particularly difficult to distinguish from
  one another. We encourage the recognition in context of other
  forms. Also, we avoid the use of ponderous terminology, which
  can overwhelm or discourage beginning students. Examples and
  exercises are repetitive in grammar and vocabulary, and often
  simple in structure. This simplicity, we believe, will allow
  greater clarity in the presentation of new concepts and grammar,
  since students will not be discouraged by lengthy practice sentences
  and copious vocabulary when they are trying to master a new grammatical
  point.</FONT></P>
