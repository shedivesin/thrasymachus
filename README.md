# Ancient Greek with Thrasymachus
This is a supplementary guide to learning the ancient Greek language using the textbook _Thrasymachus_ by C. W. E. Peckett and A. R. Munday. This supplement was written by, and is copyright, the late Alison Willard Barker (classics professor at [St. Paul's School](http://www.sps.edu), 1995-2004) and Ann Thomas Wilkins. It is available online at [http://vroma.org/vromans/abarker/thrascontents.html](http://vroma.org/vromans/abarker/thrascontents.html).

Unfortunately, the live version has many flaws due to its great age: the HTML is very outdated, the Greek text is unreadable (due to the use of a font which is no longer available), many links and images are broken, etc. I have edited the original into a version which uses modern HTML, minimal styling, Unicode, etc. (I have also removed biographical or mythographical information, since I am extremely familiar with Greek history and mythology and it is not useful to me.)

Please note that this is **for personal use only**. I do not own the copyright to this material and have made only those changes which facilitate my own use of it.
