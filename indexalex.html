  <P><FONT COLOR="#000077" SIZE="+1" FACE="Apple Chancery">Born
  near Athens around 484 BCE, Euripides, son of Mnesarchides, grew
  up to be one of the most prolific playwrights of his time. He
  wrote about 92 plays, most about controversial issues. He took
  the first set of these thinker-tragedies to the City Dionysia
  in 455 BCE, but he didn't win until 441. His lack of awards for
  his great plays may be a direct result of the content of his
  work. A pacifist with a questioning belief in his religion, Euripides
  expressed his radical ideas through his plays. One of his most
  famous works, <I>The Bacchae</I>, is one of these plays. In the
  story, King Pentheus of Thebes, unhappy with the new worship
  of Dionysus that is causing his female subjects to become insane,
  attempts to stop the worship. A deeply offended and vengeful
  Dionysus disguises himself as a mortal, and convinces the king
  to dress as a Bacchante. He then leads the disguised king into
  the mountains and places him in the custody of a wild group of
  Maenads, including his own mother, who literally tear him apart.
  The play was heralded as both a remarkable work of drama and,
  by some, as heresy. Euripides lived his life dancing across this
  thin line between genius and treason, and the only reason he
  escaped exile was that he only circulated heretical ideas in
  his plays.</FONT></P>
