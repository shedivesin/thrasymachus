    <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="+1">Hermes is the patron of thieves,
      roads, wanderers, orators, and commerce. As a patron of travelers,
      he is commonly shown wearing a straw-brimmed hat. His most famous
      representation is a sculpture by Bellini, showing him alight
      on one winged foot, with the Caduceus in his hand and a helmet/sun
      hat on his head. He is one of the twelve main Olympian gods,
      and serves as a messenger between the other gods. It is Hermes's
      job to carry newly dead souls down into Hades, and deliver them
      to Chiron. He invented the lyre, the pipes, the musical scale,
      astronomy, weights and measures, boxing, gymnastics, and the
      knowledge to care for olive trees. He has many different names,
      being called Argiphontes, for having killed the All-seeing Argus
      who guarded Io, and Psychopompus for being the guide of souls
      to the Underworld. The Romans call him Mercury. Hermes was originally
      a phallic god, being attached to fertility and good fortune.

      Hermes was the patron of roads and boundaries, as pillars called
      hermae containing his head (with a beard) were used as road and
      boundary markers. They were rectangular and made out of stone
      or bronze, with male genitalia located near the bottom. In Athens
      they were used as symbols to ward off evil. Like his father,
      he had many affairs with goddesses, nymphs, and mortals. Hermes
      is believed to be the father of Pan, Abderus and Hermaphroditus.
      He is famous for putting Argos, the hundred eyed giant, asleep
      and cutting his head off to release the captive Io. He convinced
      Calypso to release Odysseus from her charms, and additionally
      helped Odysseus and his men from being transformed into pigs
      by giving them a magic herb. He guided Eurydice back into the
      underworld after Orpheus looked at her. He was the protector
      of sheep and cattle herds, and associated with nature gods such
      as Pan. His sacred number was four, symbolizing the forth day
      of the month which was his birthday. In archaic art he is portrayed
      as a full-grown man with a bearded, occasionally bearing a sheep
      on his shoulders. From the latter part of the 5th Century he
      was portrayed as a young beardless athlete.</FONT></TD>

    <TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE="+1">According to the widely accepted
      myth concerning the birth of Hermes, his father was Zeus, while
      his mother was Maia. She gave birth to him in the morning at
      the mountain Cyllene in Arcadia. His mother wrapped him in swaddling
      bands, and then fell fast asleep herself. While Maia was asleep,
      he scampered out and ran off to Thessaly, where his half-brother
      Apollo kept his herds. He tied skins around the feet of the cattle
      so the sound of their escape could not be heard, and then led
      them to a grotto near the city of Phylos. He sacrificed two of
      the cattle, hiding the rest in a cave, and then returned to Cyllene.
      When the furious Apollo found all his cattle missing, he discovered
      by divination that Hermes had stolen them, and went of to Mount
      Cyllene.<BR>
<BR>
      However, in the meantime the young Hermes had found a tortoise,
      and by removing its entrails and stringing nine cow tendons (or
      strips of linen) across the shell in honor of the nine muses
      was able to create the first lyre. When Apollo arrived in mount
      Cyllene he was only able to find the innocent infant still wrapped
      in his swaddling blankets (as he had crawled into them before
      Apollo came). Furious at being tricked by the tiny child, Hermes
      took him to Zeus and implored him to make the child reveal the
      location of the cattle. After at first denyingthe theft and finding
      that nobody believed him, Hermes was forced to lead Apollo to
      the location of the stolen cattle. However, while he was doing
      this Apollo saw the lyre he had created and was willing to give
      all of his cattle to Hermes in exchange for it. After the exchange
      of cattle, Hermes went to the fields and made himself a shepherd's
      pipe, or syrinx (pan-pipe). Upon hearing the beautiful melody
      he played on it, Apollo offered to give him the golden staff
      he used in herding them in exchange. Hermes accepted this offer,
      but also convinced Apollo to teach him the art of divining by
      using pebbles.The golden staff that Hermes received, the Caduceus,
      represents riches and wealth and keep him unharmed. The caduceus
      was originally depicted as a willow wand intertwined with ribbons,
      the traditional badge of a herald, but these later became to
      symbolize two snakes. An additional story was later created to
      support this, telling how he separated two fighting snakes with
      his caduceus, and henceforth they twined themselves in peace
      around his staff.</FONT></TD>
