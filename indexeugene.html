  quote from Aeschylus comes from an unknown source. Most likely
  it is from one of the 97 tragedies he wrote during the fifth
  century BCE. Thankfully, due to his reknown as the &quot;father
  of tragedy&quot;, many ancient historians attempted to recover
  some of his works and fragments, such as this one. Our appreciation
  is owed to Stobaeus (mid-fifth century CE or later) who recorded
  this quote in an anthology of Aeschylus' work.</FONT></P>

  Life of Aeschylus</FONT></CENTER></ADDRESS>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Apple Chancery">Aeschylus
  was born in Eleusis in 525 B.C. According to legend, as he lay
  in a field, Dionysus came to Aeschylus in a dream ordering him
  to write plays for his festival in Athens that would revere the
  gods. The truth of this tale is questionable, but he did indeed
  write tragedies, seven of which survive and are performed to
  this day.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Apple Chancery">
  </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Apple Chancery">Aeschylus
  was accused of revealing the Eleusinian mysteries in one of his
  plays and in turn was forced to leave Athens. He went to Sicily,
  where he spent most of his life, as a member of the court of
  Hieron, the tyrant of Syracuse. Despite his absence from Athens,
  Aeschylus still participated in the festival every other year.
  Aeschylus also left two sons to carry on his legacy, one of whom,
  Euphorion, later defeated both Sophocles and Euripides at the
  Dionysia in 431 B.C. His death in 456 B.C. is said to have been
  caused by an eagle who, mistaking his bald head for a rock, dropped
  a turtle on it.</FONT></P>

  contributions to Greek Tragedy and subsequent drama were many.
  It was Aeschylus who reduced the importance of the chorus and
  made dialogue the focus of the plays. Aeschylus also developed
  the tradition of performing three plays in a trilogy at the Dionysia.
  His sway was so significant that under his influence all violence
  was removed from view and at times replaced with extravagant
  visual spectacles.</FONT></P>
