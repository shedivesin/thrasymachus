      <P>&nbsp;Solon, known to some as one of the seven wise men of
      Greece, came from a charitable, wealthy, Athenian family. Born
      in the seventh century BCE, he is the first Athenian figure known
      to historians by name, and he is said to have traced his lineage
      back ten generations to Hercules. Solon is renowned for his judicial
      contributions to Athenian law, and for such fame he now has a
      marble relief portrait outside the House of Representatives Chamber
      today. He instituted the seisachtheia or &quot;the shaking off
      of burdens&quot; in which his law nullified all debts and pledges
      of servitude, outlawed the enslavement of persons on account
      of their debts, and limited the quantity of land a man could
      possess. It was uncommon for such reforms to come from a man
      of aristocratic background, yet it is believed that he instituted
      these reforms out of a love for Athens' democracy and a fear
      of tyranny.</P>

      <P>Most of Solon's known accomplishments are documented in <A
      HREF="http://www.e-classics.com/">Plutarch's <I>Lives</I></A>,
      the source of the preceding quote. Plutarch supplies the quote
      twice, saying of Solon first, &quot;There is no doubt that he
      was a lover of knowledge, for even when he was far advanced in
      years he could still say 'I never cease to learn as I grow old,'
      &quot; and again, later, he states, &quot;Certainly, as far as
      leisure is concerned, his own verses tell us that he had plenty
      of it: 'I never cease to learn as I grow old.'&quot; The wording
      of this quote, however, leaves room for interpretation, for <FONT
       FACE="SPIonic">didasko/menoj</FONT> could be passive, &quot;being
      taught&quot; or middle, &quot;teaching myself.&quot; Whatever
      the translation, this quote and it's context in Plutarch's <I>Lives</I>
      provide considerable insight into the personality of Solon.
