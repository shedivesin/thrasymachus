  <P><FONT COLOR="#ccffcc" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">The majority
  of Aristotle's training came from the School of Athens, where
  he was mentored by Plato. (The picture below depicts Aristotle,
  on the right, with Plato). When Plato died Aristotle was not
  appointed head of the school so he returned to Macedonia to tutor
  Alexander the Great. Aristotle then went back to Athens and set
  up a school called the Lyceum. After the death of Alexander the
  Great, Athens rebelled against Macedonian rule. Aristotle decided
  it would be safest to flee to the island of Euboea. He died soon
  after.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  was an intellectual who wrote about all human knowledge as it
  was known in his time. His writings mainly fell into two categories:
  philosophical and scientific. He wrote many books throughout
  his lifetime including <I>Athenian Constitution, Economics, </I>and
  <I>Virtue and Vices. </I>Western civilization was called Aristotelian
  until the end of the 17th century.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
