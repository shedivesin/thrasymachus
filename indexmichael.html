  <P><FONT COLOR="#ff9966" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">This quotation
  comes from a speech made in <I>The Peloponnesian War,</I> Thucydides'
  magnum opus. The retreating Hellenic army, demoralized and hungry,
  had suffered a crushing defeat after the siege of Syracuse. Nicias,
  whose name rings with irony as it is derived from the Greek word

  in the Athenian army, moved amongst his men, encouraging and
  comforting them with his words and exhorting them to rebuild
  their fallen state. What follows is Nicias' speech to his troops</FONT>:</P>
  <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">&#145;Athenians and allies, even in
  our present position we must still hope on, since men have ere
  now been saved from worse straits than this; and you must not
  condemn yourselves too severely either because of your disasters
  or because of your present unmerited sufferings. &nbsp;I myself
  who am not superior to any of you in strength--indeed you see
  how I am in my sickness--and who in the gifts of fortune am,
  I think, whether in private life or otherwise, the equal of any,
  am now exposed to the same danger as the meanest among you; and
  yet my life has been one of much devotion towards the gods, and
  of much justice and without offence towards men. &nbsp;I have,
  therefore, still a strong hope for the future, and our misfortunes
  do not terrify me as much as they might. Indeed we may hope that
  they will be lightened: our enemies have had good fortune enough;
  and if any of the gods was offended at our expedition, we have
  been already amply punished. Others before us have attacked their
  neighbors and have done what men will do without suffering more
  than they could bear; and we may now justly expect to find the
  gods more kind, for we have become fitter objects for their pity
  than their jealousy. And then look at yourselves, mark the numbers
  and efficiency of the heavy infantry marching in your ranks,
  and do not give way too much to despondency, but reflect that
  you are yourselves at once a city wherever you sit down, and
  that there is no other in Sicily that could easily resist your
  attack, or expel you when once established. The safety and order
  of the march is for yourselves to look to; the one thought of
  each man being that the spot on which he may be forced to fight
  must be conquered and held as his country and stronghold. Meanwhile
  we shall hasten on our way night and day alike, as our provisions
  are scanty; and if we can reach some friendly place of the Sicels,
  whom fear of the Syracusans still keeps true to us, you may forthwith
  consider yourselves safe. A message has been sent on to them
  with directions to meet us with supplies of food. To sum up,
  be convinced, soldiers, that you must be brave, as there is no
  place near for your cowardice to take refuge in, and that if
  you now escape from the enemy, you may all see again what your
  hearts desire, while those of you who are Athenians will raise
  up again the great power of the state, fallen though it be.</FONT></I><B><FONT

  </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">A bit after the age of thirty,
  Thucydides was elected to the board of strategoi, a board of
  military men who exercised political power in foreign affairs.
  He was given command of the Athenian fleet in the seas around
  Thrace. The Spartans defeated his fleet in a surprise attack
  on Amphipolis. He was exiled for this failure and returned to
  his home shortly before his death in 404 BC.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Thucydides meant to write<I>
  th</I>e definitive work on the the Poloponnesian war -- in his
  own words, he wrote &quot;not for immediate applause but for
  posterity.&quot; This aspiration makes his work doubly interesting
  as he wrote the history of the war more or less </FONT><FONT
   FACE="Arial">contemporaneously </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">with
  its occurrence. He took notes on the events as they happened,
  later organizing them into a coherent and sequential story. Lastly,
  he embellished and augmented them, making them into a fascinating
  history ready for public consumption.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
