      <P>&nbsp;This quotation is an aphorism attributed to <A HREF="http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/antisthe.htm">Antisthenes</A>
      in the fifth section of &quot;The Life of Antisthenes&quot; in
      the sixth book of Laertius's exhaustive <I>Lives and Opinions
      of Eminent Philosophers. </I></P>

      <P><A HREF="http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Anci/AnciLuz.htm">Antisthenes</A>
      was an Athenian philosopher and is considered to be the founder
      of the cynic sect.  He was born in 440 B.C.E. by a Thracian of
      Phrygian mother, and thus only half a citizen.  He earned fame
      through the valor which he displayed in the Battle of Tangora.
       After this, he began to study under the sophist Gorgias.  However,
      he became increasingly dissatisfied with Grogias's teachings
      and after a chance meeting with Socrates, he decided to abandon
      his sophist views.  He became one of Socrates' most ardent followers,
      and Socrates' impression on him is clearly evident throughout
      Antisthenes' teaching.  Like Socrates, Antisthenes believed that
      virtue was necessary and sufficient for true happiness.  He also
      felt that virtue could be taught, and once the knowledge was
      acquired it could not be lost.  Furthermore, his postulation
      that each individual is unique had interesting implications for
      ethics and for the theory of knowledge.
